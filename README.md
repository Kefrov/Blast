# Blast
Remake of the mobile game "Block Blast" using Pygame.
## Dependencies
- Python
  - [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) → Install with:  
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
- C++ (Used for encrypting the high score value)
## How to Run
- To run the game, use:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
## Additional information
- [highscore.py](https://github.com/Kefrov/Blast/tree/main/highscore.py) and [hash_decrypt.exe](https://github.com/Kefrov/Blast/tree/main/hash_decrypt.exe) work together to ensure that the high score remains secure
- Each time the high score is saved, it is encrypted before storage. (Might not be the most secure method, but it works for this project)

I made this in only 5 days but it's my best project to date. <br>
